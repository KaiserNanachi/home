What to nerf? Revert his charge CD? Fire strike to 90dmg per shot? Shield cooldown increase when broken? I don't agree with your statement btw, but just saying he needs a \"reverse Sojourn...\" isn't giving a clear solution.","@CamboyYour @OW_SVB This. You know in plat how many people see me going rein and they pick bastion for instance to just absolutely melt me?","@vawkie @OW_SVB That should already happen, if the dps just shoot the shield :)","@noobcorni @OW_SVB Replace orisa with Zarya and I will agree with this.","@OW_SVB In my plat games, I’ve never seen a rein shield break, people don’t understand how to play against rein at all","@OW_SVB Ramatra and Junkerqueen run over Rein though?","@OW_SVB Nah\nIn high metal ranks ram and also sigma are really strong. It depends on the map and team comps but like 4 times out of 5 Ram is the best pick in my experience. Ram just doesnt die sometimes because you will find a lot of supports healbotting him the whole round in these ranks","@OW_SVB the nobrain solution: keep every number the way it is, but make it so that deactivating shield puts you at a cool down of 3 seconds before you can recast, and make the shield regenerate slightly faster","@kristwiii @OW_SVB I mean if the mercy is good she's supposed to climb, no?","@OW_SVB Rein has ALWAYS been like that though, at least in the lower ranks. Nerfing him won’t change that, and I think promoting other strategies can be achieved by implementing a tutorial mode and explaining basic game concepts like space, high ground, target priority, etc.","@OW_SVB Idk I honestly think in terms of low ranks orisa and ram are far more of an issue","@vawkie @OW_SVB I don't think that's the problem though, the issue is that lower ranksa do not know how to deal with an overly AGGRO tank. Yeah, it would make the shield bot rein less viable but I don't think that playstyle is the one that is getting bronze players into plat rn.","@OW_SVB As a metal rank player I tell you this: I would rather have a Rein bash any day of the week over fucking ball, orisa, hog. That shit is worse","@OW_SVB this is so true if ur team gets doom, winston ball zarya etc  then enemy rein will walk at u with kiriko or alone  with 1 million hp .nth u could do as dps or sup so boring only in lower ranked tho i find ball to be annoying in gm+","@OW_SVB Tbh SVB I am currently 16-6 with Ramattra at bronze it really isn't a hero problem it is more of understanding how to deal with heroes like Rein and Ram. A metal rank player doesn't always have that.","@OW_SVB Honestly i think all the tanks are","@OW_SVB It’s the same with mercy super strong at lower ranks. How do you think DPS will kill anything there if a good mercy is on the other side?","@OW_SVB I don’t know about this. Leave rein alone and worry about actual broken heroes like syms charge time or moiras ability to hold right click on you from the literal other side of the objective. Or Sojourns one shot abilities. Or immortal ball. There’s bigger issues than rein.","@OW_SVB He's a roadblock. We need to rally all Rein haters.","@pall_emil @OW_SVB Silver player here,  yeah. Good take actually","@OW_SVB 100% agree! An enemy Rein can create so much space, simply by walking forward. It requires the friendly team to really work together to take him down, and unfortunately that does not often happen in the metal ranks.","@Zero_o_w @OW_SVB I'm in silver personally,  obv still learning  how to actually play the game. Rein isn't that easy to roll w in my opinion.","@OW_SVB I don't disagree, but with her insane survivability and tendance to counter other tanks isn't orisa even worse for this?","@OW_SVB maybe implement a shield decay for when rein holds his shield up too long?","@OW_SVB low rank also don't know how to punish improper cooldown use, but typically people will just outplay themselves because they play too braindead","@OW_SVB I don't think he's too much in low elo I mean","@OW_SVB I think it is the fact that most other tanks revolve around cooldown management and when used improperly can die when caught out.\nMeanwhile Rein just goes ungabunga in low ranks and doesn't have really strong cooldowns to manage","@OW_SVB No no. But people listen to you. At the very least I would think the devs/team look your way. Hell you called low tier \"metal ranks\" now it's everywhere","@OW_SVB As someone in the metal ranks, this is very false.  Rein is still a very counterable option in the metal ranks, especially with the amount of heroes across the board with great shield spam.","@OW_SVB Disclaimer: I haven't played in almost 2 weeks bc my wifi has been down.\nI am in silver, in tank specifically. I play Dva, Sigma and Ball (sometimes). I find Rein really engaging to play against.\nIdk if it's some placebo or smth but I don't too much in low ranks fr fr.","@OW_SVB nerf his shield buff his health. means the rein has to take a more active role in the fight instead of shieldbotting","@pall_emil @OW_SVB Hog can check rein pretty easily tbh but then you have the  ana zen bs man goddamn. Tanking is just not it rn","@OW_SVB Rectangle man go brrr","@OW_SVB If you have a suggestion that would keep his viability In master+ and need him in ranks below I would also like to hear that","@OW_SVB To be completely honest I feel like blizzard shouldn’t touch him anymore until the next hero eventually fucks everything or sucks complete ass. Rein is in a position where yeah sure he gets a lot of value for not a lot of skill but the game needs those hero’s for newer payers imo","@DrunkBearded I wouldn't classify GM as low end, personally","This right here\nSVB with the 10/10 W take https://t.co/FgCAfmklcG","@OW_SVB Bro.

<p>・小泉首相が特に多く言及するトピックは経済、地方、国際、財政である。やはり聖域なき構造改革、三位一体改革等の経済、行政改革による財政健全化を行っていたことから整合的である。</p>
<p>・一方安倍首相が比較して多く言及しているのは育児、高齢化、憲法と賃金である。小泉首相があまり育児政策や高齢化政策に重きを置かなかったことが要因と思われる。また、憲法と賃金問題を特に争点にしていたことは記憶に新しい。</p>
